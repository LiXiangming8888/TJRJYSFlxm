Description: My R package in the course of WangCheng.
    This course is in 2021-Fall, one of the compulsory course of Applied Statistics Master.
    In this course, we learn how to use R to write some function to realize some particular purposes, for example, how to sort a sequence of numbers (homework 1).
    Besides, we also use R to do some statistics analysis and statistics learning problem, such as logistic regression, LDA, KNN and SVM (Midterm task).
    In week 10, we learn how to build our R package so that we can put the functions we write, data we use together.
    As the course going on in the future weeks, I may put more thing in this package and the version will be changed, too.
